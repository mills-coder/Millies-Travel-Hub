<p>In an increasingly digital world, IT is becoming more and more central to the business as a whole. With businesses needing to become more agile and innovative, they’re looking to IT to increase productivity, value and efficiency. This is being put into practice with businesses working more collaboratively and utilising new tools such as Kanban, allowing them to solve complex problems [2]. Furthermore, IT is no longer the job of one team, but is become interdisciplinary requiring staff from across the business to interact better with technology [1].</p>

<h3 class= 'makemewhite'>1.2</h3>
<p>The methods, skills and resources needed to complete a digital project successfully are wide ranging. An example of skills that can aid in the success of a project is teamwork. The Scrum framework relies heavily on good teamwork, organised within the product team. This helps to speed up development, stops products being outdated, stops them running over schedule, or over budget. The ‘sprint’ periods direct the team towards a goal and sets aside a defined amount of time to do this in [10]. A common collaborative method used in project work is ‘Kanban’. Many projects fail as they lack efficiency and have no clear insight into what the team is doing, the use of Kanban was designed to help combat this. As a visualisation tool it helps team identify what there is to do giving them a clearer cut goal to work towards [11]. Likewise, Trello a resource for creating Kanban boards makes this approach even easier. It can be updated at any time by all members of a team, giving power to each member to highlight what they feel is important [3].</p>

<h3 class= 'makemewhite'>1.3</h3>
<p>Trello is a collaborative tool which is used for project work [3]. Its basis is in the ‘Kanban’ method, using ‘cards’ on a ‘board’ to identify what there is to do, what is being done and what has been completed. It is a flexible tool that can be continually updated to factor in the organic nature of project work. In order to plan my website, I will use Trello to ascertain what steps I need to take to make sure I have covered my brief. I have used ‘To Do’, ‘Doing’, ‘Review’ and ‘Done’ as my boards so that once I have completed a task, I can review it at a later stage before moving it to done.</p>

<h3 class= 'makemewhite'>1.4</h3>
<p class= 'makemewhite'>When a digital project is begun, the risks that the team my encounter must be planned for. One of the biggest risks is failing to plan, no matter the size of a project it should include risk mitigation. By including effective mitigation and risk management a project team will be better prepared if any incidents do arise. We often see digital projects failing as there is not enough funding to complete them, causing them to be abandoned. Further examples of possible risks are competitors, a shift in business direction, projects being out of line with standard business processes and key members of the team leaving [5]. As more areas of the business become intertwined with IT, digital project will require more planning and consideration to collaboration [12].</p>

<h3 class= 'makemewhite'>1.5</h3>
<p class= 'makemewhite'>To select the appropriate IT systems and software there are many factors that you need to consider. By first identifying the size of the project, as this can affect the choice of technologies. For a smaller project well established stacks such as Python-Django can work best as the project is smaller and requires less complex technology. In addition, budget for a particular project may greatly affect what type of technology is selected. In a smaller business or a project with a small budget, cheap or free versions of software might be more cost effective. Developers will also need to be confident in the selected systems and software, if they lack experience in a newer technology system it may not be suitable to select this over a more established system. However, the ideal is a system that is neither too old nor too new, allowing the team to work effectively and keep up with the latest developments. [8][9]</p>

<h3 class= 'makemewhite'>1.6</h3>
<p class= 'makemewhite'>By using Trello and organising my project in Kanban I’ve been able to categorise the key tasks for this assignment. In addition to the cards I have created, I have made use of the label feature. This separates each topic by a different colour and title, making them easily identifiable on the board. I have assigned ‘questions’ a green label and ‘unit 1 outcome 1’ a purple label. As there are a large number of questions, having the purple label means I can see which relate to which unit. By employing Git and GitHub you are able to manage your source code history. These systems work to save each version of your code, making it easy to identify where you may have made changes. Git is a non-cloud-based system that is stored locally and gives you access to the different versions of your code. Whilst Git doesn’t need the internet to run, GitHub does. This is due to it being a cloud-based system. Similar to Git it stores the different versions of your code, but it works as a database which stores and can share projects outside of your computer. Being able to keep track of any changes made allows for better control over a project [13].</p>

<h3 class= 'makemewhite'>1.7</h3>
<p class= 'makemewhite'>GDPR was introduced by the EU in May 2018 to replace the Data Protection Act (1998). In order to be compliant with GDPR, software developers need to implement the appropriate measures to stop the unnecessary processing of personal data. The impact of GDPR on digital projects can affect the planning, as if the guidelines are not followed there is the risk of sanctions. Working within the constraints of these guidelines, developers need to think about how the data is stored, who has access, how long it can be kept for. They need to implement features to support the guidelines, which may impact who works on a project, what it is they design to avoid legal action being taken [6] [7].</p>
