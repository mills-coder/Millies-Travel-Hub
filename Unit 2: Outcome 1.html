<p class= 'makemewhite'>When designing my webpage, I first selected the theme I wanted. This was a ‘travel’ theme, meaning the content would be based around exploring, adventure and travel. I have named my website ‘Millie’s Travel Hub’, which is displayed on my first page as a heading and in the head search bar. For my first page I’ve used a picture I took on a Thai beach for the background, I’ve kept this consistent throughout; adding it to all my other tabs. The heading ‘Millie’s Travel Hub’ is on the left-hand side of the page with ‘About Me’ underneath. In my ‘About Me’ section I have included a bio and formatted it in an opaque blue box, laid out in the top half of the page. Across all my pages I have included a navigation bar, this is coloured in different shades of blue and sits in a row across the very top of the page. For this I have used the same font as my headings, the font is evocative of maps and beach signs which is appropriate for my theme. I have also included emojis which relate to travel, adding to the aesthetic value. I have named the remaining tabs after each unit, on unit 1 outcome 1, I have created paragraphs which back onto a blue opaque box with black text and white identifying numbers. This is the same across unit 1 outcome 2, unit 1 outcome 3 and unit 2 outcome 1. Moreover, I have included a references page to hold my research, this follows the same format of an opaque blue box over the beach scene. The references are all linked and lead to the relevant pages. Lastly, my contact me page has a heading of ‘Contact me’ followed by a travel quote which sits centrally. I have also included a box to input contact details.</p>

<p class= 'makemewhite'>Copyright may affect websites through the material displayed but also the code used to create them. Copyright can be defined as “The legal right that someone has to control the production and selling of a book, play, film, photograph, piece of music etc. for a particular period of time” [19]. Although people’s work and code may be freely displayed online, it does not mean it can be used freely. It is important to read any terms and conditions so as to avoid infringing on copyright. If the material is yours and you wish to display it freely, you will need to choose a license to give them permission to do so. Without permission lawsuits can be filed and fines given, causing financial loss [14] [18].</p>

<p class= 'makemewhite'>The internet is being used more and more, with the increase in usage the need for accessibility is increasingly more important. An example of ways in which we can improve accessibility is through alternative text. For an internet user with a visual impairment alternative text is essential, without it the information is inaccessible. This is because they may use a screen reader, which reading the text off a page cannot interpret images. Whilst accessibility helps people with disabilities it can contribute even further, improving user experience and satisfaction. We can increase fonts, making it easier for people with visual impairments but also older people to view the webpage. When implementing changes to boost accessibility, it is best to work on these at the start of a project, to be more efficient and effective [15].</p>

<h3 class= 'makemewhite'>1.7</h3>
<p class= 'makemewhite'>When creating a website, it is important to consider the different filetypes you want to use. There are a number of different filetypes that can be used to display an image, such as PNG, JPG and GIF. Depending on how high you wish the quality to be on your image and the size of the file, you will need to select a specific filetype. JPG is the most commonly used, with small file size and high compatibility. However, the compression of images in JPG can cause small details to be lost increasing each time the image is saved. It also cannot be used with transparent backgrounds and is not easily layered with other elements. In order to increase image quality a PNG filetype can be used, it doesn’t lose any detail when compressed but the file size increases greatly when saved in this format. When displaying graphical images, a PNG file works best, keeping the text quality. Furthermore, video and audio files can also be used in websites. In recent years new formats for video have been introduced such as WebM commonly seen in HTML5 for short clips that can be embedded into websites. The ease in which this filetype can be inserted has no doubt aided its popularity and appropriateness for websites [16] [17].</p>
