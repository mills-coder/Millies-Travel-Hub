    <h3 class= 'makemewhite'>3.1</h3>
    <p class= 'makemewhite'>The IT tools and systems used to create my website both helped and hindered my productivity and efficiency. Due to limited training in HTML and CSS it took me longer to create and style my website, making me less efficient. If I had completed this project in a team, we may have been more productive, as the shared knowledge and skill levels would allow us to support each other and ultimately resolve problems faster. When completing this project, I didn‚Äôt use the tool Zoom as it was independent and did not require collaboration. Collaborative tools such as Zoom boost productivity and efficiency as they are live and you are able to discuss problems with your team members without needing to wait for replies, as is the problem with email. Similarly, to Zoom, Slack enables good communication and through being able to post snippets of code, allows for the team to share their work. The code snippet feature on Slack is useful for formatting, meaning you can simply copy and paste into your system and run the code. This feature helps to increase efficiency, reducing the time spent typing out shared code.</p>
           
    <h3 class= 'makemewhite'>3.2</h3>
    <p class= 'makemewhite'>The ways in which I have improved my productivity and efficiency over the course of this project are varied. I have found short breaks spread out across the day help me to focus, this is due to time away from the screen. By having time away from the screen, I am able to refresh and increase my focus when I come back to the task. Similarly, I have found the weekly yoga sessions incredibly helpful through the stretches and breathing exercises used to relax. I also track my water intake to make sure I stay hydrated and can retain my focus, therefore allowing me to be more productive and efficient. </p>
    
    <h3 class= 'makemewhite'>3.3</h3>
    <p class= 'makemewhite'>Reflecting on this project, I have been able to identify solutions to improve productivity. As this was an independent project, I had full control over all decisions made. Allowing me to style my website and choose the content. However, with a limited time frame and working alone I have not been able to thoroughly complete all of my ideas. If this was a team project, we may have been able to complete more and further customise our webpage, giving each member of the team sections to work on; improving our productivity. Having used Slack in previous projects to communicate within a team, its usage in an independent project was reduced; being used only to discuss any questions I had with my instructor. By using Slack in group projects productivity can be enhanced as team members are able to easily communicate and share any problems they may have, posing them to the team to find a resolution. If I was to complete this project again it may be helpful for it to be a group piece as it is likely we would be able to accomplish more in the timeframe. </p>


    <h3 class= 'makemewhite'>3.4</h3>
    <p class= 'makemewhite'>The role of testing is to identify any problems, allowing you to resolve them. In order for a website to look professional and be fit for purpose it needs to run smoothly. I would start by testing the pages myself to detect any issues or sections that could be worked on, making sure each is consistent. This would be followed by user testing, allowing a user to provide feedback on how they felt the website looked as well as the features in place. </p>
