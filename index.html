<h3>About Me</h3>


<div class="background">
<div class="transbox">
   
<p>My name is Millie. As an avid traveller, I’ve spent a number of months in the last few years exploring. Having travelled to Australia and Asia in 2014/15 and with trips all around the globe in 2017-19, I decided in 2020 I wanted to go even further. At the start of this year I left my job and got ready for a six-month trip to South and Central America. However, after six weeks I had to return home and the UK was brought into lockdown. Over the past couple months, I’ve looked at my skills set and where I would like to improve. I have a keen interest in social media, but lack experience in IT. I wanted to enhance my IT knowledge and coding seemed like a good place to start. This led me to the Code Nation ‘Develop Coding’ course, which as a three-week intensive, has exposed me to a number of different programs and software.</p>
