    <h3 class= 'makemewhite'>2.1</h3>
    <p class= 'makemewhite'>The use of varied IT tools aided me in completing my project. Most notably Visual Studio Code and Trello, these programs allowed me to both plan and complete my brief. The adaptability of Visual Studio Code to support a range of programs meant I could easily store my files in one location. Having one folder for this project that housed HTML and CSS, limited the back and forth and allowed me to keep on top of my tasks and identify if I had missed something. With the introduction of CSS to my project I changed how I approached HTML, inserting the relevant code to add the visual elements to my webpages. Furthermore, I am pleased with how Trello worked for this project. The labelling feature has allowed me to break up my cards into groups and easily identify which relates to which unit. As this project was independent, I changed my approach to what I had done previously with Trello whilst in a team. This meant controlling the board myself and making sure to update it when a task was being done/completed. I also did not need to mark out who had completed which task as I had completed it all myself. </p>
           
    <h3 class= 'makemewhite'>2.2</h3>
    <p class= 'makemewhite'>The IT tools I used to complete this project were appropriate for the brief. Both Visual Studio Code and Trello were suited to this type of project. Trello allowed me to methodically plan out my project, using its Kanban board structure. It is an interactive tool that which worked well with the time frame of this project, helping me to sort my tasks into cards and work through them quickly. Likewise, Visual Studio Code allowed me to insert pictures and stylise my website through the CSS program, an important feature of front-end development. By having one folder within Visual Studio Code for my project it meant I didn‚Äôt need to open multiple folders at one time, overall helping me in making sure everything was completed. </p>
    
    <h3 class= 'makemewhite'>2.3</h3>
    <p class= 'makemewhite'>When assessing the strengths and weaknesses of my project, I have looked at both my research and the final product. I am happy with the theme of my website, as multiple features evoke travel and holidays such as the emojis and colour scheme. This is what I intended with my website, by using blues and warm oranges I feel I have achieved those feelings. One of the main weaknesses is the lack of features. This is due to having limited time to complete the project, as well as limited training in HTML and CSS. If I had additional time to practice using these programs, I feel I would be able to further improve and include a range of new features. Moreover, with a short timeframe to finish this project I was limited to what I could include. If I had longer to complete it, I would have worked more on the layout of the pages, creating smaller boxes for each paragraph of text and shifting their positioning on the page. I would also have included buttons and further interactive features to make it more user friendly. I dislike the lack of images and would like to have added additional images that perhaps linked to other sites.</p>
    
    <h3 class= 'makemewhite'>2.4</h3>
    <p class= 'makemewhite'>The improvements I feel could be made to my project include further developing the formatting of my webpages. This could include updating the layout, shifting text boxes around the page and adding extra colours to each box. This would add to the aesthetic appeal and make the pages more interesting. Furthermore, I would upgrade my navigation bar by making it blend into the page better. I would also like to create a logo, if I had had more time to complete this project this is something I would have added. The logo would include my website name ‚ÄòMillie‚Äôs Travel Hub‚Äô but also include beach/jungle related icons in complimentary colours to my background. Further improvements would be an additional page dedicated to pictures, this could be regularly updated, and I would include a comments section.</p>
    
    <h3 class= 'makemewhite'>2.5</h3>
    <p class= 'makemewhite'>When reviewing my project, I have matched it against the brief in order to check it is fit for purpose. I have selected appropriate formatting for my pages to allow ease of navigation and clarity. This is evident in the navigation bar at the top of the page, this is clearly labelled directing the user to the different pages via a link and it stands out due to the colour scheme I selected. Similarly, I have labelled each paragraph with its unit number so as to make it clear what it relates to. In relation to linking information across pages, I have added the navigation bar which includes a page for references. This displays all my research and links in a new tab to the sources. Moreover, I have prepared appropriate content for my website fitting it to my brief and making sure to include all the relevant information. I have selected a theme and consistently displayed this throughout the website. </p>
